# <h2>Elite Agility</h2>

This year you get to nominate and vote the winners for each movie category in the American Movie Awards.

This application is an instant search tool using a dataset. After looking up three movies, a voting system is enabled where the anonymous voter nominate movies for different awards. Once the tallies from a large group of voters are in, a secondary vote occurs for runner-up and winner.
